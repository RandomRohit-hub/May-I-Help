System Design and Connectivity Assurance\\n4.1 Autonomous Failover Logic\\n\\nThe core value for BSF is the autonomous failover logic that ensures the device always selects the best available communication link.\\n\\nLogic Flow (High Level)\\n\\nStart → Check VHF Signal (Proximity) → if available: Send via VHF (Low Power) → else: Check GSM Coverage → if available: Send via GSM → else: Send via Satellite (Last Resort) → Update HQ Dashboard.\\n\\n4.2 Data Parameters\\n\\nKey telemetry values transmitted from field devices to HQ:\\n\\nParameter\\tDescription\\tSignificance for BSF\\nMODE\\tCurrent network status (VHF/GSM/SAT).\\tImmediate display of operative's link reliability to HQ.\\nRSSI\\tReceived Signal Strength Indicator.\\tUsed to trigger the automatic, predictive network switch before total signal loss.\\nSOS_FLAG\\tEmergency signal (instant alert).\\tTriggers high-priority alert and location pin at Command Center.\\n5. Implementation, Testing, and Conclusion\\n5.1 Successful Testing (Field Condition Simulation)\\n\\nThe prototype demonstrated seamless switching across simulated field conditions:\\n\\nLow Latency: Minimal delay during VHF ↔ GSM / Satellite transitions.\\nAccuracy: GPS lock sustained during network changes.\\nReliability: SOS alerts routed via the best available link instantly.\\n5.2 Conclusion (SIH 2025 Achievement)\\n\\nMMTT directly addresses BSF's need for uninterrupted, simplified communication in border environments. It offers a low-cost, high-impact solution that strengthens force coordination, situational awareness, and troop safety for critical missions.\\n\\n5.3 Future Enhancements (Post-SIH Roadmap)\\nIntegrate LoRa communication for ultra-low power, short-range mesh networking.\\nAdd AI-based anomaly detection to flag unusual troop movement and potential threats.\\nDevelop a fully ruggedized, wearable vest-mount form factor optimized for BSF field operators.\\n\\n\\n\\n==============================\\nSOURCE URL:\\nhttps://www.playmetrics.site/about\\n==============================\\n\\n404\\n\\nOops!
